# Java Projects
This directory contains Java sources. All the Java projects have been developed
using the Eclipse IDE. If you want to contribute, I highly suggest you using the
same development environment setup.

# Getting Started
To get going and start working on the Java sources you only need the appropiate
version of Java and of the Eclipse IDE installed.

## Java
The development is currently using JRE 1.8_231.

### Linux
Under Arch Linux, to install the full JRE, JDK, related documentation and
sources, just run:
```
sudo pacman -S jre8-openjdk jdk8-openjdk openjdk8-doc openjdk8-src
```

### Windows
On Windows 10, the appropiate version `jre-8u231` can be downloaded from
![Java SE Runtime Environment 8 Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html)

## Eclipse
Download and install `Eclipse IDE for Java and DSL Developers` from
![Eclipse IDE Oxygen 3a Packages](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/oxygen/3a).

The `/parrot/src/java` directory can be used as the Eclipse Workspace directory.
Import all the projects.
